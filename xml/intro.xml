  <title>Useful &vi; Settings</title>

  <para>
   &vi; stores its settings in &vimrc;. Here are the ones that I generally
   find useful. Note that lines starting with <literal>"</literal> are
   comments.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    After you make changes to &vimrc;, you can apply them without restarting
    the &vi; session with <command>:source ~/.vimrc</command>
   </para>

  <para>
   If you use tabs to edit several files at once, it is handy to map the
   following shortcuts to switch between them.

  <title>&vi; Plug-ins</title>

  <para>
   Although &vi; is a full featured editing environment in its core
   installation, you will probably want to extend its functionality after
   some time. Either to do specific tasks more easily, or to teach it brand
   new features. And this is where &vi; plug-ins take part.
  </para>

  <para>
   There are thousands of &vi; plugins available online. A good place to
   start searching around is for example
   <link xlink:href="http://vimawesome.com"/>. There you can filter the list
   of viewed plug-ins by categories and tags. Installation instructions are
   presented for each plugin as well.
  </para>

  <para>
   Manual installation of plug-ins seems to be a thing of the past. To ease
   the plug-in management, it is better to install just one of them - a
   <emphasis>plug-in manager</emphasis>. There are several plug-in managers,
   some of which even take care of parallel plugin installation and online
   updating. The most popular are vim-plug, Vundle, or NeoBundle.
